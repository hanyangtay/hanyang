Everything about me, Han Yang Tay, with my live code projects

Seeing is believing, visit me here (https://hanyangtay.herokuapp.com).


## Projects

### Personal Portfolio

Built with Google's Material Design Lite framework, featuring a responsive design.
All I have to say is, front-end development is tedious. 

Tools used: HTML, CSS, MDL framework, Adobe Photoshop

### Mini-Twitter

A Twitter app with my own UI design concept. Built with Ruby on Rails.
It's live! You can play with it here (https://hanyangtay.herokuapp.com/login).

* Dynamic web-page
    * Ajax calls for new posts, likes, retweets, follows and deletes
    
Users can see their stats update immediately upon any of the actions. Only relevant sections of the web page are reloaded, saving user bandwidth.
    * Server-side and client-side validations
    
Learned the importance of assuming a malicious user, and how to prevent website from being vulnerable to most SQL injections, rainbow attacks etc.
And that server-side validations always trump client-side validations.
* User authentication model
    * E-mails for account activations and password resets
    
Learned that HTML e-mails are really tedious to craft.
    * Guest account access
    * Secure password hashing (storage of password digests in database)
    * Pseudo-randomly generated avatar images for new users (can be changed)
* Tweet model
    * Upload photos
    * Like, retweet, delete
* Social Media
    * Follow, unfollow users
    * Dynamically created status feed
    
Learned the MVC model by repeatedly attempting to code different relationships between users and their posts. 

Tools used: Ruby on Rails, Heroku Postgres, Jquery
