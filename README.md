Seeing is believing, visit me here (https://hanyangtay.herokuapp.com).


## Projects

### Personal Portfolio
---

Built with Google's Material Design Lite framework, featuring a responsive design.
All I have to say is, front-end development is tedious. 

Tools used: HTML, CSS, MDL framework, Adobe Photoshop

### Mini-Twitter
---

A Twitter app with my own UI design concept. Built with Ruby on Rails.
It's live! You can play with it here (https://hanyangtay.herokuapp.com/login).

#### Dynamic web-page

Users can see their stats update immediately upon any of the actions. Only relevant sections of the web page are reloaded, saving user bandwidth.
    
#### User authentication model
  * E-mails for account activations and password resets
  * Guest account access
  * Secure password hashing (storage of password digests in database)
  * Pseudo-randomly generated avatar images for new users (can be changed)
  
Always assume a malicious user.
Server-side validations are a must, and always trump client-side validations.
   
#### Tweet model
  * Upload photos
  * Like, retweet, delete
    
#### Social Media
  * Follow, unfollow users
  * Dynamically created status feed
    
Learned the MVC model by repeatedly coding different relationships between users and their posts. 

Tools used: Ruby on Rails, Heroku Postgres, Jquery
